## Future Implementations
  - Use Javascript to put animations on the 3D shadows on the Home page.
  - Use Javascript to change the layout of the gallery, with names of the creations written, that would display the creation on hover.
  
## Testing
I tested my website on Mozilla Firefox, Opera and Chrome, and there's no noticeable problem.
### Fixed Bugs
During the development of the Gallery page, I ran into an issue with the positioning of the pictures, when i was using float.
This was due to not putting the size of the pictures in my CSS file. 
I decided to change the layout to a grid, to make it more responsive.

## Accessibility
I have been mindful during coding this website to ensure that it was as accessible friendly as possible.I've made that possible by:
 - Using semantic HTML
 - Giving an alt attribute to every pictures on the websites
 - Giving a aria-label to videos, and icons in the footer.
 - Giving an aria-hidden attribute to the icons in the About page.
 - Ensuring the colour contrast in the site is strong enough to meet the accessibilty norm.
