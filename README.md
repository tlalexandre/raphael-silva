## Future Implementations
  - Use Javascript to put animations on the 3D shadows on the Home page.
  - Use Javascript to change the layout of the gallery, with names of the creations written, that would display the creation on hover.

## Accessibility
I have been mindful during coding this website to ensure that it was as accessible friendly as possible.I've made that possible by:
 - Using semantic HTML
 - Giving an alt attribute to every pictures on the websites
 - Giving a aria-label to videos, and icons in the footer.
 - Giving an aria-hidden attribute to the icons in the About page.
 - Ensuring the colour contrast in the site is strong enough to meet the accessibilty norm.
